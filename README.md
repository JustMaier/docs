If you're using Git Bash, we recommend following [Evan Will's guide to adding more tools to Git Bash](https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058).

## Contributing

**Contribute to the [Textile Docs](https://github.com/textileio/docs)** with any additions or questions you have about Textile and its various projects. A good example would be asking, "What is a thread?". If you don't know a term, odds are someone else doesn't either. Eventually, we should have a good understanding of where we need to improve communications and teaching together to make Textile even better.

Before you get started, be sure to read our [contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [contributor covenant code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
